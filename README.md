# SquidLibSharp
A C# .NET port of some of SquidLib  
![Apache 2.0](https://img.shields.io/github/license/yellowstonegames/SquidLibSharp)

This library targets .NET Standard 2.0. This ensures compatability with Unity projects, as well as any other modern .NET targets.

### Caution!
Extremely early state, expect there to be lots of sweeping changes as things are added and assessed.

## Prject Structure
This repository has multiple solutions, representing bundles of functional differences.
 - Squidlib.sln: The library itself, by itself
 - Squidlib Testing.sln: The library bundled with the unit tests
 - Squidlib Framework Demos.sln: The library bundled with demos that use .NET Framework 4.7.2
 - Squidlib Core Demos.sln: The library bundled with demos that use .NET Core 3.1
